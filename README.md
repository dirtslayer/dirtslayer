# Darrell's Github

I have many interests and do a lot of unfinished work. I am happy to answer any questions you may have. Most of the work here is very non-technical, just using a lot of stuff to get a feel for it.

What I am working on:
  - Organizing my life with Logseq
  - Personal health goals
  - Web development
    
Under construction
