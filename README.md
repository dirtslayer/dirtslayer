November 2025 yo!
================

## working On
- love2d game fspace, a simple asteroids clone that wasnt planned
  
- nushell config / picture of the day
  old worthwhile configs that I still use all the time
  
- mdbook kb maybe
  my nth abandoned journalling project

- abandoning cachy for trixie
  everyone has to grow up sometime even me, but already notice perf hit :(
  hopefully its a driver issue, but investigating gamemode and zen kernel on deb

## thinking about
- creating characters
- narratives that are one possibility of many
- zen light love2d
